<h3>About this dashboard</h3>

This dashboard was designed as part of the <a href="https://wp.lancs.ac.uk/net0i/">Net0i project</a> at Lancaster University, funded by the <a href="https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/T025964/1">UKRI project EP/T025964/1</a>.
The project aims to create insights from energy data for energy managers and other stakeholders to identify energy savings towards a Net Zero future.

<br><br>

While there are a plethora of existing dashboards, who inspired and motivated us, we decided to created yet one more to focus on one specific issue: <b>Context</b>.
As we highlighted in a recent <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10506051">journal article</a>, "data" can take many different forms, but to explain data we often require context, and the existing dashboards we surveyed didn't quite satisfy our needs, nor that of our stakeholders.
This dashboard therefore attempts to be a testbed for a new vision of exploring data: while providing different ways to browse and analyse energy data, we want to be able to add context, or we call it sometimes "comments" in this tool, to explain/elaborate/question any insights we discover.
Key academic takeaways of this approach and a brief overview can be found in <a href="https://wp.lancs.ac.uk/net0i/files/2025/06/2025-remy-contextviz.pdf">this paper presented at ICT4S 2025 in Dublin as a poster</a>.
